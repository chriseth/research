## The structure of catalytic space

Cook, Li, Mertz, Pyne (2025) [The structure of catalytic space](https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~iwmertz/papers/clmp25.structure_of_catalytic_space.pdf).

Main results:

- CBPL = CL: bounded-error randomized catalytic logspace is equal to catalytic logspace.
- any problem in P and in CL also has a polynomially time-bounded catalytic machine.
- catalytic logspace is equivalent to polytime-bounded, zero-error randomized catalytic logspace.

Main technique: "compress or random", i.e. the contents of the catalytic tape are either "random enough" to use as randomness in a deterministic machine or they can be compressed and the freed spaced on the catalytic tape can be used for computation.
